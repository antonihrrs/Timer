This is my final project to finish up the Python course "The Legend Of Python" that Codedex.io offers.

This is april 8th 2024

NB : I made this timer a little bit over a month ago (around march 3rd)

This was my first time make a Graphic User Interface
In terms of quantity of new elements intertwined with one another added up with using a library (tkinker) I had never used before.

It's use is pretty self-explanatory :
The user enters how many seconds they want a countdown from, press the start button and here it goes.
The timer is turning X seconds from the user in min+secs if the user has given more then 59 seconds.
When the countdown is done, a message "time is up" shows up.
